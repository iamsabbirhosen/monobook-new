## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to evoke a sense of wisdom and focus, reflecting the academic nature of the app.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA), a desaturated variant of indigo, providing a calm and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft violet (#8A2BE2), analogous to indigo but brighter, for highlighting important interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and short chunks of text, with 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text.
- Use simple, clean icons to represent actions and categories, ensuring they are easily understandable and consistent with the overall design.
- Maintain a clean, structured layout that prioritizes readability and ease of navigation, with ample whitespace to prevent the interface from feeling cluttered.
- Incorporate subtle animations, like a smooth page transition effect, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
